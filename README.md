# This repository contains the code I write as I learn C++.

## Reasons for learning C++
Having worked only with relatively high-level programming languages so far in my career (Python, MATLAB), I wanted to learn more about the underlying mechanics of how these programmes were interacting with the underlying computer. I decided C++ would be a good language to learn because it teaches me a lot about what is going on 'under the hood', how memory allocation and management works, how algorithms are designed, and what the data structures and functions I had been using until this point were actually doing. I also hope that learning these things will help me write faster, more efficient code and help me when learning other programming languages in the future. 

## Subfolders
The subfolders within this repository contain the different ways I have been learning C++. 

### Tutorials
For an introduction to how C++ works, I have been following the excellent and in depth online tutorials found at https://www.learncpp.com/

### DataStructures
To practice writing in C++, I am learning how to implement some of the most common data structures (Linked Lists, Heaps, Stacks, ...)

### SortingAlgorithms
For more practice, I am also learning how to implement various common sorting algorithsm in C++ (Selection, Insertion, Bubble, Quick, ...)
