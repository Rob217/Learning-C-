This repository contains my code for learning C++. 

Reasons for learning C++:
Having worked with relatively high-level programming languages (Python, MATLAB), I wanted to learn more about the underlying mechanics or how my computer programmes were interacting with the underlying machine. 


1. I wanted to learn more about how computer programming works: how software interacts with the underlying processor, how memory is stored, how computations are done, etc.
2. I wanted to speed up my numerical computation.

There are a variety of different ways I am doing this. 

Tutorials - I have been following the excellent and in depth online tutorials found at https://www.learncpp.com/

DataStructures - I am applying my
